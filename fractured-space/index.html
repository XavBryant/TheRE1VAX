Endeavor

--

Currently my favorite ship.

--

The ship with my own biuld, enables my playstyle that seems to make it versatile.

It is an interesting ship. It is versatile, when with crew it can be quite survivable, and turrets allow to to cover ground and soften targets allowing you to flank.

It has good armor which allows it to take a decent beating.

Main weapon is quite effective! I built for high rate of fire. With good damage, AOE, and good range its a fine weapon as you move around your turrets.

Turrets also periodically release missiles. This missile barrage is quite useful on unarmored targets.

Concussion mines deal a very good amount of damage, and can be used to attack ships at a distance, or used defensively if you get rushed.

Gravity well is good for moving large ships out of cover, or even out of open space.

Watchman -- USR [United Space Research]

The sniper for USR, boasts very good damage for precise shots at extreme ranges.
8000 base hull hp
600 base speed


======RE1VAX Synapse:
--Extremely niche and high skill curve, but can be very effective at many ships
--Effective solo
--System denial

Tactical Analysis:
[Primary] Railgun: Very long range, decent projectile speed (still hard to hit at long ranges)
Against Amored: Good damage, consistent.
Against Unarmored: Very very good damage. Take out that Destroyer at 21km and not even blink... by yourself.

[Secondary] Short-range void cannon:
<8k range.
Extremely useful. Good damage, useful against small mining ships.
Can be used to augment Railgun at closer ranges for very high potential dps.
360 range.

[Dispersal Slow Shield] Reduces damage by 50% for 5s.  Afterwards, slows enemy ships nearby by 20% for 5s.
--Useful to survive hard attacks or missile salvos. Medium reload (50s).
--Slowing debuff never really proved useful, as turning around is never a good idea, and is hard to do.

[Watchman Missiles] 18km range. Short reload (20s)
--Extremely useful at softening up targets at long ranges. Good for finishing small ships at low health.

[Corrode Drones] 36k range. 30s operation. Reload 20s, if squad dead 75s.
--The extra trick up watchmans sleeve. Corrodes armor of an entire target.
--Very useful for medium to large targets, as this allows primary to deal exceptional damage.
--(Note: I found that the cooldown is quite short in practice)


Other notes:
Ship is good at strafing a target at long ranges. This can make it easier to land leading shots (my personal experience).
In a team situation, this ship can be very good for defending a sector, and preparing for Gamma.
1. Sit in a flanked position middle of the ally side of the sector, close to cover. Lay cover for allies and keep back adversaries.
2. Arrive early in Gamma. Get a good position and strike early, preping them up for ally firepower.
